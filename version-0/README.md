# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


📝 Writing a README
A well-written README helps others (and your future self!) understand, use, and appreciate your project. Here’s a quick guide to writing one.

📌 What Is a README?
A README.md is usually the first thing someone sees in your repo. It gives an overview of what your project is about, how to use it, and how it works.

You spent hours on your project — spend at least 30 minutes writing a clear README. It’s your chance to tell the world what your hard work is all about!

🧹 Tips
Don’t overthink it! Just explain your project clearly
Use headers, bullet points, and links to keep it easy to read
Update the README if your project changes
🎨 Markdown Formatting Tips
README files use Markdown (.md) to style content.

Common Markdown formatting:
# H1 (Main title)
## H2 (Section)
### H3 (Subsection)

**bold text**  
_italic text_  
`inline code`  

- bullet points
1. numbered lists

✨ Features
What are the features that you implemented in the app? For example:

List the pages you built (e.g. Home, About, Dashboard)
Describe what the user can do on each page (e.g. view data, submit a form, search, etc.)
